	Assay
		Analytical procedure, encompassing sample preparation, data-acquisition, and feature extraction, for the characterisation of the chemical composition of samples. The datasets generated by an assay may provide measures as relative or absolute quantifications, for either absolute chemical names, or annotated and unknown :term:`features<feature>`.

	Assay Role
		The rational for aquisition of a specific sample (see :py:class:`~nPYc.enumerations.AssayRole`).

	Analytical Batch
		Set of :term:`study<Study Sample>` and :term:`reference samples<Reference Sample>` acquired in a single continuous analytical run, without planned interruption *i.e.* instrument maintenance.

	Batch Effects
		Analytical and preparative influences that may cause a systematic difference in measurements taken at different points in time.

	Correction Batch
		In the ideal case, analytical :term:`batch<Batch Effects>` and :term:`run-order<Run-Order Effects>` effects are detected and corrected based on the :term:`analytical batches<Analytical Batch>` into which the study has been divided. However in the event of unplanned interruptions to an analysis, it may be necessary to further sub-divide the run into a series of correction batches.

	Discrete Data
		Analytical data in which the adjacency of variables is unimportant to their interpretation. Peak-picked :term:`UPLC-MS`, targeted, and clinical measures are typically of this type.

	Feature
		Measured entity from a specific :term:`assay`, that proxies the abundance of a chemical in the assayed sample. Each chemical in a sample may give rise to none, one, or several features in the dataset generated from a specific assay.

	Long-Term Reference
	LTR
		A specific :term:`sample type<Sample Type>`/:term:`assay role <Assay Role>` combination consisiting of samples with *External Reference* and *Precision Reference* assignment. These represent a type of QC sample useful, for example, for bewteen-study comparisons.

	Mass Accuracy
		The precision by which the :term:`m/z` of an ion can be measured in :term:`mass spectrometry`. Typically expressed in :term:`ppm<ppm (MS)>` and calculated by: :math:`\Delta m_i = \frac{ (\mathit{m_\mathrm{i}} - \mathit{m_\mathrm{a}}) }{\mathit{m_\mathrm{a}}} \times 10^6` where :math:`\mathit{m_\mathrm{i}}` is the observed mass and :math:`\mathit{m_\mathrm{a}}` is the true mass. 

	Mass-to-Charge Ratio
	*m/z*
		:term:`Mass Spectrometry` term describing the measurement of an ions mass relative to its charge.

	Mass Spectrometry
	MS
		Analytical technology that :term:`assays<Assay>` a sample in terms of the observed :term:`mass-to-charge ratio` of the constituent compounds.

	Matrix
		The source of a :term:`specimen<Study Sample>`, for example, urine, blood-plasma, or serum.
	
	Notation conventions (code)
		Matrices are set :math:`UPPERCASE`, vectors :math:`lowercase`, and scalar values :math:`\mathit{italic}`.

	Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
	NMR
		Analytical technology for :term:`assaying<Assay>` samples by detection the resonance of atomic nuclei in a magnetic field.

	Participant
	Subject
	Sample Source
		The source of a :term:`study sample` (generated at a :term:`sampling event`), which could represent an individual, experimental site or condition, or other.

	ppm (NMR)
		Parts-per-Million, a measurement of the chemical shift of a nucleus (:math:`\nu`) in :term:`NMR`, expressed as a ratio to the spectrometer frequency (:math:`\nu_\mathrm{ref}`) by: :math:`\delta = \frac{ \mathit{\nu} - \mathit{\nu_\mathrm{ref}}}{ \mathit{\nu_\mathrm{ref}}}`.

	ppm (MS)
		Parts-per-Million, used as a measure of :term:`mass accuracy` in :term:`mass spectrometry`.

	Preparative Batch
		A group of one or more :term:`sample batches<Sample Batch>` handled and prepared together, using a single batch of reagents.

	Reference Sample
		Reference samples are measured to characterise the stability of assays during the course of an acquisition, and account for platform dependant analytical variability. There are several common forms of reference sample, including :term:`Study Reference<Study Reference>`, :term:`Long-Term Reference<Long-Term Reference>`.

	Rerun Assay
		Replicate :term:`analytical data<Sample Assay>` acquired from a sample that obsoletes any data previously acquired. For example, :term:`study samples<Study Sample>` reacquired following analytical issues are reruns.

	Repeat Assay
		Replicate :term:`analytical data<Sample Assay>` acquired from a sample that augments any data previously acquired. For example an interruption in the acquisition of an MS batch may cause an additional dilution series to be acquired when analysis resumes.

	Relative Standard Deviation
	RSD
		The RSD provides a measurement of analytical precision, expressed as a percentage. The RSD is calculated for :term:`feature` :math:`x`, from repeated measurements (typically of the :term:`study reference` samples), by: :math:`\mathit{rsd(x)} = \frac{\mathit{\sigma_{x}}}{\mathit{\mu_{x}}} \times 100`.

	Resolution
		The ability of an instrument to separate two signals.

		In :term:`NMR` resolution is directly related to the magnetic field strength, and typically expressed in terms of the resonant frequency of the hydrogen nuclei in H\ :sub:`2`\ O at room temperature.

		In :term:`MS` resolution is measured and calculated by :math:`r = \frac{\mathit{m_\mathrm{i}}}{\mathit{w_\mathrm{1/2}}}`, where :math:`\mathit{m_\mathrm{i}}` is the nominal mass of an ion, and :math:`\mathit{w_\mathrm{1/2}}` is the measured peak-width at half-height. 

	Retention Time
		Measurement of the time of elution of a feature as observed in a specific :term:`UPLC-MS` chromatographic method. Internally, all nPYc toolbox retention times are expressed in seconds unless otherwise noted.

	Run Order
		The sequence in which :term:`samples<sample>` are :term:`assayed<assay>`.

	Sample
		A single specimen to be :term:`assayed<Assay>`. May be divided into two :term:`broad classes<sample type>`, :term:`study samples<study sample>` which form the core of an analysis, and :term:`reference samples<reference sample>`, that allow that characterisation of analytical performance.

	Aliquot
		Aliquots are one or more sub-fractions of a :term:`sample` that may be considered functionally equivalent. Setting aside handling considerations, aliquots may be combined or split with no impact on sample composition or the expected result of an :term:`assay`.

	Sample Assay
		Analytical data acquired by a single :term:`assay`, from a single physical specimen.

	Sample File Name
		Unique name of an assay data file. Two :term:`sample assays<Sample Assay>` acquired from the sample physical sample (for example, a :term:`rerun<rerun assay>`), will have unique Sample File Names.

	Sample Base Name
		Common name for all comparable assays of the same sample. For example, reacquisitions of the same sample will share an identical Base Name.

	Sample Batch
		A collection of :term:`study samples<Study Sample>` (typically 80, to allow formatting onto a 96-well plate with room for :term:`reference samples<reference sample>`) plus some number of :term:`reference samples<Reference Sample>`, prepared and analysed together.

	Sampling Event
		The specific point in time at which a :term:`sample<Study Sample>` was generated. One sampling event may produce several equivalent :term:`aliquots<Aliquot>`. Note that obtaining samples of blood-plasma and urine from a :term:`participant` at the same time is considered two sampling events, as the biofluids obtained are not interchangeable.

	Sample Type
		The overarching compositional class of a specific sample (see :py:class:`~nPYc.enumerations.SampleType`).

	Continuum Data
	Spectral Data
		Analytical data in which the adjacency of variables is significant. Examples include :term:`NMR` spectra, or mass-spectra recorded in continuum mode.

	Study
		A collection of :term:`samples<Study Sample>` for analysis, constituting a single project.

	Study Sample
	SS
		Samples comprising the :term:`study`.

	Study Reference
	SR
		A specific :term:`sample type<Sample Type>`/:term:`assay role <Assay Role>` combination consisiting of samples with *Study Sample* and *Precision Reference* assignment. These represent the classic QC sample used in profiling studies to assess analytical stability.

	Serial Dilution Sample
	SRDS
		A specific :term:`sample type<Sample Type>`/:term:`assay role <Assay Role>` combination consisiting of samples with *Study Pool* and *Linearity Reference* assignment. Used to asses the linearity of response of :term:`features<feature>` during analysis.

	Run-Order Effects
		Analytical factors that may affect the measurement of :term:`features<feature>` in a dataset by introducing progressive assay-to-assay biases in measurement. Examples include the gradual decline in observed intensity of measurement in ToF MS detectors.

	Ultra-Perfomance Liquid Chromatography Mass-Spectrometry
	UPLC-MS
		Analytical technology for :term:`assaying<Assay>` samples, coupling chromatographic separation with :term:`mass detection<MS>`.
